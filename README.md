# Dynamical differential covariance (DDC)
All scripts were carefully annotated. Below is a quick summary.
## Connectivity estimation:
  * estimators.m: Common estimators including covariance, precision matrix <x,x>, nonlinear averaging matrix <R(x),x>, first-order derivative computed by symmetric difference quotient 
  * dCov_numerical.m: numerical estimations of the time derivative
## Network simulations:
  * Linear_simulation.m
  * Nonlinear_simulation.m
  * LIF simulation.m
  * :Reduced Wong-Wang simulation
